Used to track changes and submit the Python Challenge for Bootcamp: Data-PT-West
Created main.py file for PyBank challenge.  Used a mix of recources from Data-PT-West instruction and Xpert Learning Assistant
Colaborated with others in the class and refined my code in Pypoll.  I do have quesitons on why we would need a seperate list of cadidates names since we are only using one CSV file.
